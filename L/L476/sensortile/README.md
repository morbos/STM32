# Ada on the ST SensorTile

This project shows how to initialize a SensorTile and how to send
sensor data over BLE from a SensorTile to a suitable host (that host
might be another SensorTile). There are two roles, a server and a
client. Servers accept connections and can send back sensor data when
prompted. Clients can scan for a server and prod the server to send
sensor data.

- cd ..
- cd STM32/L/L476/sensortile
- symlinks are an issue on Windows for gprbuild. So the sensortile.gpr
needs to be modified to be an relative path. Same a few dirs up in
L/common. Adding -v to the Makefile at the gprbuild will show where
the issue is. If this is flagged as an issue I will modify the tree
for the future. Not sure how many Windows users of my tree there are.
- make
