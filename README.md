This is a work in progress for STM32 projects

Currently the L432 is being worked on. This was for the MakeWithAda
contest. My project was to use the VL6180X range sensor to tip a
see-saw back and forth. To do that needed the range sensor
working. There is a working program for the board I am using in
STM32/L432/sensors/vl6180x_l432.


Further, now there is a demo of a seesaw for the MakeWithAda
contest. It is in: STM32/L432/demos/seesaw

The L432 SoC is realized for this project on the 32pin Nucleo-L432KC
board.
